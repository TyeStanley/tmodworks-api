# TModWorks API

A .NET Web API backend for the TModWorks desktop application, providing centralized storage and management of curated game cheats and memory modifications.

## Overview

TModWorks API serves as the backend for the [TModWorks desktop application](https://github.com/TyeStanley/tmodworks-app), a React/Next.js frontend built with Tauri. The API provides a centralized database system for storing game cheats, their memory addresses, offsets, and configurations. This allows you to easily apply cheats for multiple games through the desktop application.
